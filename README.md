### What is Test Driven Development ( TDD ) ?

+ Test-Driven Development, or TDD as it is commonly referred to, is the development process in which tests are written first, then the code to support them is created, and, when every test passes, code is refactored.

+ The general TDD workflow looks like this:
	+ Write tests
	+ Run tests to see that they fail
	+ Write the code and make it pass the tests
	+ Refactor the code

+   In this project, I solved the algorithm questions on the [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) website with the TDD approach. I am going to add more detail about project in the future.
